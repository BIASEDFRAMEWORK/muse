# AI Implementation Prompt: epic-002-feature-002-prompt-001

## Objective
Implement Document Access Audit Logging — implementation path.

## Repo Context
- Primary code paths: src/cli/, src/pipeline/, src/config/
- Generated artifacts: specs/capabilities/, specs/epics/, specs/features/, specs/stories/, work-items/prompts/stories/
- Story linkage: epic-002-feature-002-story-001 -> epic-002-feature-002 -> epic-002

## Required Changes
1. Implement Document Access Audit Logging — implementation path.
2. Apply least-privilege authorization checks for the implementation path.
3. Ensure structured logs for the implementation path are queryable for compliance evidence.

## Constraints
- Preserve traceability metadata and naming conventions for generated artifacts.
- Do not modify files under /docs/organizational-contracts without explicit instruction.
- Keep changes scoped to the requested objective and avoid unrelated refactors.
- Use governance source: /Users/dustingaspard/Documents/Excella/Workspace/Muse/specs/governance/original-document-system-of-record.digital.md

## Acceptance Criteria
- Behavior for the implementation path records timestamped evidence with actor identity attribution.
- Audit and security events for the implementation path are written to secure, access-controlled logging or storage.
- Automated tests validate success, failure, and evidence-capture behavior for the implementation path.

## Validation
- `npm run build`
- `node scripts/validate-traceability.mjs`

## Deliverable
Return a patch plus a short summary of modified files and validation results.

## Implementation Brief
Implement Document Access Audit Logging — implementation path.
Context: enforce document access audit logging for the implementation path.
Return production-ready code changes, unit tests, and integration tests with explicit acceptance-criteria mapping.

## Implementation Checklist
- Behavior for the implementation path records timestamped evidence with actor identity attribution.
- Audit and security events for the implementation path are written to secure, access-controlled logging or storage.
- Automated tests validate success, failure, and evidence-capture behavior for the implementation path.
- Implementation outcome is unique to epic-002-feature-002-story-001 (Document Access Audit Logging — implementation path).
